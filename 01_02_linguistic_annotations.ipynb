    "In this chapter, we will start working with spaCy directly. The goals of this chapter are twofold. First, it is my hope that you understand the basic spaCy syntax for creating a Doc container and how to call specific attributes of that container. Second, it is my hope that you leave this chapter with a basic understanding of the vast linguistic annotations available in spaCy. While we will not explore all attributes, we will deal with many of the most important ones, such as lemmas, parts-of-speech, and named entities. By the time you are finished with this chapter, you should have enough of a basic understanding of spaCy to begin applying it to your own texts."

You should notice that the open and close parentheses are also considered an item in the container.

Tokens are something that has syntactic purpose in a sentence and is self-contained. A good example of this is the contraction \"don't\" in English. When tokenized, or the process of converting the text into tokens, we will have two tokens. \"do\" and \"n't\" because the contraction represents two words, \"do\" and \"not\".\n",

Again, we will iterate over the doc object as we did above, but instead of iterating over doc.sents, we will iterate over doc.ents. For our purposes right now, I simply want to print off each entity’s text (the string itself) and its corresponding label (note the _ after label). I will be explaining this process in much greater detail in the next two notebooks."
